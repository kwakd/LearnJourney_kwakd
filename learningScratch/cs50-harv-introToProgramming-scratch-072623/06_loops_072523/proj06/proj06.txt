Project 6: Loops

Your assignment is to create a Scratch project where a sprite repeats some behavior multiple times.
Your project should include:
	(The below requirements are distinct. You must have both kinds of loops in your project!)
	- At least one forever block.
	- At least one repeat block.

Make sure you share your project publicly, as by clicking Share in Scratch's top-right corner
so that others (such as the grading staff) can see your project.
