Project 8: Abstraction

Your assignemnt is to revise one of the projects you've already created.
Find some sequence of blocks that you use multiple times, and organize them into a custom block.

Make sure you share your project publicly, as by clicking Share in Scratch's top-right corner
so that others (such as the grading staff) can see your project.
