Project 5: Conditions

Your assignment is to create an interactive Scratch Project that behaves differently depending on what
choices the user makes. Your project should include:
	(The below requirements are distinct. One is a single-branch conditional statement, one is a
	multiple-branch conditional statement. Including only one of these two DOES NOT satisfy both
	requirements. You must have both kinds of conditions in your project!)
	- At least one if block.
	- At least one if/else block.

Make sure you share your project publicly, as by clicking Share in Scratch's top-right corner
so that others (such as the grading staff) can see your project.
