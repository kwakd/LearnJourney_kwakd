ASSIGNMENT
1.
"This" is a good video on Emmet. Go ahead and watch it up to 11:37 as it 
demonstrates some content we haven’t covered yet. We’ll get there eventually.

2.
Take a look at the "Emmet cheat sheet." You don’t have to memorize it, but it’s 
good that you get familiar with the different ways it can be used.

3.
Go through the "Emmet documentation." Once again, no need to memorize everything 
but it would be good if you played around with all the different possibilities.
