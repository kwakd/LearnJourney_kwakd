ASSIGNMENT
1. 
Read through this "HTML elements reference" to get an overview
of what other HTML elements are available to you. No need to 
commit this to memory because you’ll be learning the important 
parts as we go, but having a glance now will help the content 
stick later.

2.
Take a glance at a somewhat overwhelming looking "CSS Cheat Sheet."
Again, we don’t need you to learn anything specific, or 
memorize anything from this list. Just use it to get a feel for 
what you still have left to learn!
