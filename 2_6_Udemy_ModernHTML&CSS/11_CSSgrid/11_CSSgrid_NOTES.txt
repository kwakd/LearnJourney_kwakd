11_1: What Is CSS Grid?
	- What Is CSS Grid?
		- Grid layout system for CSS
		- Similar to flexbox (more powerful but a bit more difficult)
		- Two-dimensional layouts
		- Can use "align-items", "justify-content", etc
		- Partial support for IE11
	- How It Works
		- display: grid; */ Creates a "grid" */
		- All direct child elements are "grid items"
		- "grid-template-columns" defines width and number of cols

	- Grid vs Flex
		- It is NOT one or the other!
		- Use CSS Grid for outter elements and grid-like layouts
		- Use Flex for simple alignment (Inner elements, menu items, etc)
		- Most of the stuff we have done so far, I would use flex
