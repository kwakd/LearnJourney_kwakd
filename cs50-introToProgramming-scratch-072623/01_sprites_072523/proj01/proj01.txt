Project 1: Sprites

What to Do:
1. Download and install the latest version of Chrome, if you don't have it already.
2. Visit scratch.mit.edu and sign up for an account, if you don't already have one.
3. Sign in to your Scratch account and click the "Create" button to create a new project.

Your assignment is to create a scene in Scratch. Your scene should include:
	- At least one additional backdrop (in addition to the default blank one)
	- At least three different sprites

Make sure you share your project publicly, as by clicking Share in Scratch's top-right corner
so that others (such as the grading staff) can see your project.
