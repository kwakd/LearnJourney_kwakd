Project 4: Values

Your assignment is to create an interactive Scratch Project where the user types in answers to questions. 
Your project should include:
	- The ask and wait block.
	- The answer block.
	- The join block.

Make sure you share your project publicly, as by clicking Share in Scratch's top-right corner
so that others (such as the grading staff) can see your project.
