	- 12_DataTypes
		- Primitive Data Types
			- String: Sequence of characters. Must be in quotes or backticks
			- Number: Integers as well as floating-point numbers
			- Boolean: Logical entity / true or false
			- Null: Intentional absense of any object value
			- Undefined: A Variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
			- Symbol: Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
			- BigInt: Numbers that are greater than the "Number" type can handle
		- Reference Types (Objects)
			- Reference types or "objects" are a non-primitive value and when
			assigned to a variable, the variable is given a reference to that
			value.
			- Object literals, arrays and functions are all reference types
		- Static Typing VS Dynamic Types
			- JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. This means, we do not explicitly
			define the types for our variables. Many other languages are statically-typed
			such as C, C++ and Java
			- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which allows static-typing this can
			make your code more verbose and less prone to errors. TypeScript may be something
			you want to look into later on.

		- Data Types
			- Primitive Types: Stored directly in the "stack", where it is accessed from
				- String | Number | Boolean | Null | Undefined | Symbol | BigInt
			- Reference Types: Stored in the heap and accessed by reference
				- Arrays | Functions | Objects
